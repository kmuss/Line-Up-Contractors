# Line-Up-Contractors


Goal of this final project is to build or imporve the information systems for an exisiting business. Our client was a contracting business - Line Up Contractors - and through surveying, interviewing and discussing back and forth, we built our client a website with multiple landing pages and a database to store all inputted information. Website has portols for a potential customer, employee and manager - and each user has specific access to the website.

Inside you will find a entity relationship model, data-flow diagram, and a physical data-flow diagram, all were used to build the databse.
